# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## 🔹 Welcome to Atlantis!
<pre>
풍부한 자원과 찬란한 문명을 가졌지만
물 속에 잠겨버린 <i>전설속의 도시</i>
<b>아틀란티스</b>를 들어본 적 있나요?


그럼 우리도 자신만의 <b>아틀란티스</b>가 있다는 것을 아시나요?
매일 밤 잠에 들면 꿈 속에서 나만의 아틀란티스가 펼쳐집니다!
무한한 상상력과 가능성을 가진 나의 세계에서 만들어진 스토리
나만 알고있기 아깝지 않으신가요?


나의 이야기를 공유하고
다른 사람의 상상력을 덧붙여 만들어진 
<i>이미지, 음악, 단편소설, 웹툰, 노래가사</i> 등을 공유하고
하나의 작품을 완성시키는 플랫폼 
<h3><b>아틀란티스</b>에 도착하신 것을 축하합니다!</h3>
